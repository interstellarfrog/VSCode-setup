# Interstellarfrogs vscode setup

This is my custom vscode/vscodium setup with over 20 themes and over 50 extensions that incorporate everything from linting for many languages to AI Autocomplete using google cloud AI and tabnine.


This profile is made for Rust development but many other languages are supported

main aspects:

- google cloud AI
- tabnine
- All the best Rust extensions - Debugging, tauri, yew, EBT, Flowistry, test exporer all the standard and more
- Moderate python support
- Libre C# support
- Javascript, html, css support
- better comments
- Github integration
- 20+ themes
- Markdown preview
- Icon themes
- formatting with Prettier, and other formatters for languages it does not support (yaml ect.)
- npm support
- TODO tree
- version lens, error lense - to show errors and versions inline
- assembly syntax support

I am using vscodium insiders, all of the extensions are previews or betas when available and all the telementary settings that I know of are turned off unless needed for beta access.

For my font I am using Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font.

Feel free to remove extensions, especially if you do not have a google cloud AI account or tabnine account (both of these are free to sign up for), or add more extensions.



Also remember you can use `CTRL` + `-` or `CTRL` + `+` to make the text smaller or bigger.
